* Data Buffer
** Buffer Sizes
- Size of entire buffer: 1382400 bytes
- Equivalent to 'uint8_t data[1382400]'
- Size of 'Y' buffer:
  - Starts at data[0]
  - Ends at data[921599]
  - 921600 bytes
  - Equivalent to 'uint8_t Y[921600]'
- Size of 'U' buffer:
  - Starts at data[921600]
  - Ends at data[1151999]
  - Equivalent to 'uint8_t U[230400]'
  - 1280*720 + (1280*720)/4 -> 1152000
  - 230400 bytes
- Size of 'V' buffer:
  - Starts at data[1152000]
  - Ends at ata[1382399]
  - Equivalent to 'uint8_t V[230400]'
** Relationship Between Y, U, and V
- A given pixel is indexed by it's x(width),y(height) coordinates
- The pixels are arranged as matrix that is 1280x720
- The index of the U data for a given pixel in the U vector is:
  U[x/2 + ((y/2)*640)]
** How many loop iterations should there be
- There are 921600 pixels
- If each inner loop iteration handles 8 pixels, there should be 115200 iterations
- Keep the outer loop at 720 iterations
- Shrink the inner loop to 160 iterations
